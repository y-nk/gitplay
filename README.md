# gitplay

## what

A simple vscode extension to control git history log with key bindings.

## why

I'm doing more and more presentations where my slides are more-or-less empty screenshots of code using [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh), and while presenting i spend a lot of time doings alt+tab between slides and vscode containing the exact same code ; so i thought "what if my git commits were my slides?"

## how

Install this extension using vscode marketplace. The extension exposes 3 commands in the command palette called "Git Play: Go to first commit", "Git Play: Go to previous commit", "Git Play: Go to next commit".

I've mapped them by default as:

- first commit: double cmd+h
- prev commit: double cmd+j
- next commit: double cmd+k

## wait

There will be some restrictions and bugs, so you're free to open issues and i'll take a look whenever i can. you're also more than welcome to point at better solutions or do PRs if you want to.

## notes

I don't intend to cover every single platform or usecase here. I'll try my best to be civil and help a fellow out, but this is a side gig to support presentations i do at work ; i've no time to waste on it. Please be patient and kind on your expectations.
